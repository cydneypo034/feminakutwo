                Feminaku was founded in 2018 and is an upcoming social networking application 
                for women who love all things anime. Feminaku is a combination 
                of the word feminine and otaku, a Japanese term for people with obsessive 
                interests, particularly in anime and manga. Feminaku 
                has a target audience of women because the amount of social networking 
                sites that are geared towards women who love and watch anime is very low.
