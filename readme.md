Feminaku is an upcoming social networking application for women who love all things anime. Feminaku is a combination of the word feminine and otaku, a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests, particularly in anime and manga. Feminaku has a target audience of women because there is a lack of communities geared solely toward women who love gaming and anime. We see Feminaku as a way to "bring all the magical girls to the table". It is an application that is LGBTQ+ - affirming, minority-based and ran by women that continues to provide a safe space that's enjoyable, inclusive and engaging for all women of all ethnicities and backgrounds.
