                Feminaku was founded in 2018 and is an upcoming social networking application 
                for wxmn who love all things anime. Feminaku is a combination 
                of the word feminine and otaku, a Japanese term for people with obsessive 
                interests, particularly in anime and manga. Feminaku 
                has a target audience of wxmn because there is a lack of communities geared solely 
                toward wxmn who love gaming and anime. We see Feminaku as a way to "bring all the magical girls to the table".
                We are a company that is LGBTQ+ - affirming, minority-based and ran by wxmn that continues to provide a safe space
                that's enjoyable, inclusive and engaging for all.
